# Encapsulation

# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). 
# It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
# This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly 
# and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
# To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. 
# Those types of variables are known as private variables.

# A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, 
# variables, etc.


# Python program to
# demonstrate private members

# Creating a Base class
class Base:
	def __init__(self):
		self.a = "GeeksforGeeks"
		self.__c = "GeeksforGeeks"

# Creating a derived class
class Derived(Base):
	def __init__(self):

		# Calling constructor of
		# Base class
		Base.__init__(self)
		print("Calling private member of base class: ")
		print(self.__c)


# Driver code
obj1 = Base()
print(obj1.a)

# Uncommenting print(obj1.c) will
# raise an AttributeError

# Uncommenting obj2 = Derived() will
# also raise an AtrributeError as
# private member of base class
# is called inside derived class
